# Windows Server Management Application Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Functional Enterprise System
**Selected Approach:** Design System - Microsoft Fluent Design System
**Justification:** This is a complex enterprise tool requiring clarity, efficiency, and trust. Users need quick access to critical information and clear visual feedback for potentially destructive operations.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors (Dark Mode):**
- Background: 220 25% 6% (deep slate)
- Surface: 220 20% 12% (elevated cards)
- Primary accent: 210 100% 60% (Microsoft blue)
- Text primary: 0 0% 95%
- Text secondary: 0 0% 70%

**Status Colors:**
- Success: 142 76% 36% (green)
- Warning: 38 92% 50% (amber)  
- Error: 0 84% 60% (red)
- Info: 217 91% 60% (blue)

**Light Mode Alternative:**
- Background: 0 0% 98%
- Surface: 0 0% 100%
- Primary: 210 100% 45%
- Text: 220 15% 20%

### Typography
**Font Family:** 'Segoe UI', system-ui, sans-serif
**Hierarchy:**
- Headers: 24px/32px semibold
- Section titles: 18px/24px medium
- Body text: 14px/20px regular
- Captions: 12px/16px regular
- Code/commands: 'Consolas', monospace

### Layout System
**Spacing Units:** Tailwind 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- Consistent p-4 for cards
- m-6 for section spacing  
- gap-4 for component grids
- h-12 for input heights

### Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Collapsible sidebar with icon + text labels
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies
- Tab navigation within modules (AD/ADCS/DNS)

**Data Display:**
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, pagination
- Status badges with consistent color coding
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Expandable rows for detailed information

**Forms & Controls:**
- Standard form inputs with clear validation states
- Multi-step wizards for complex operations
- Confirmation modals with command preview
- Bulk action toolbars

**Enterprise-Specific Elements:**
- Health status tiles (3x2 grid on dashboard)
- Real-time console output panels
- Server connection status indicators
- Audit trail timestamps and user attribution

### Key Design Principles

1. **Safety First:** All destructive actions require explicit confirmation showing exact PowerShell commands
2. **Real-time Feedback:** Live status updates and streaming command output
3. **Information Density:** Efficient use of space for data-heavy enterprise interface
4. **Consistent Status Language:** Green/amber/red status indicators throughout
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex operations broken into manageable steps

### Interaction Patterns
- Hover states reveal additional actions
- Loading states during remote command execution
- Inline editing for quick property changes
- Contextual right-click menus for power users
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

### Visual Hierarchy
- Dashboard tiles as primary focal points
- Module sections clearly separated
- Critical alerts prominently displayed
- Secondary actions de-emphasized but accessible

This design prioritizes clarity, safety, and efficiency for IT administrators managing critical Windows Server infrastructure.
